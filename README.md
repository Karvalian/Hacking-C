# Hacking using C-Language
# Accessing Machine code of a gcc compiled program
To look at the machine code of a gcc compiled program(Simple Program that prints Hello World! 10 times), we can use objdump <br />
Example command: <br />
objdump -D {filename} | grep -A20 main.: <br />
Example output: <br />

The objdump program displays alot of instructions thats why we just grep the useful information inside the main() function.
Each bytes is represented in hexadecimal notation(base-16 numbering system), This is a convenient notation because a byte contains 8 bits. Each of which can be either true or false.
This means that a byte has 256 possible values so each byte can be described with 2 hexadecimal digits.
The hexadecimal numbers on the far left are memory adresses. The machine language instructions are put on the memory(A collection of bytes of temporary storage space that are numbered with addresses).
You can think of memory as a row of bytes, each with its own memory address. Each byte of memory can be access by its address, Here the CPU accesses this part of memory to retrieve the machine language instructions for the compiled program.
Older Intel x86 processors use a 32-bit addressing scheme, while newwer ones use a 64-bit one. 32-bit processors have 2^32 possible adresses(4,294,967,296), 64 bit ones have 2^64(1.84467441x10^19)addresses.
64-bit processors can run in 32-bit compatibility mode which allows them to run 32-bit code quickly.

# How to use GDB to show the state of the processor registers before the program starts.
gdb -q ./a.out <br />

Explanation:
A breakpoint is set on the main() function so execution will stop right
before our code is executed. Then GDB runs the program, stops at the
breakpoint, and is told to display all the processor registers and their
current states. <br /> 
# Registers
EAX(Accumulator), ECX(Counter), EDX(Data), EBX(Base) are general purpose registers. They are used for a variety of purposes, but they mainly
act as temporary variables for the CPU when it is executing machine
instructions. <br />
ESP(Stack Pointer), EBP(Base Pointer), ESI(Source Index), EDI(Destination Index)are also general-purpose indexes but they are sometimes known as pointers and indexes. <br /> 
The first two registers are called pointers because they store 32-bit addressses,which essentially point to that location in memory. These registers
are fairly important to program execution and memory management. <br />
EIP(Instruction Pointer) register points to the current instruction the processor is reading. This register is quite important and will be used a lot while debugging. <br />
EFLAGS register consists of several bit flags that are used for comparisons and memory segmentations. <br />
# Intel-ASM syntax
I will be using Intel syntax assembly language, our tools must be configured to use this syntax. To set gdb to use Intel Syntax we can put a simple command in the gdbinit file. <br />
Commands: <br />
echo "set disassembly intel" > ~/.gdbinit <br />
Intel Assembly syntax <br /> 
operation <destination>, <source> <br />
The destination and source values are either a register, a memory address or a value. <br />
mov is used to move a value from the source to the destination, sub to subtract, inc to increment... <br />
For example: <br />
mov ebp,esp <br />
sub esp,0x8 <br />
This code moves the value from esp to ebp and then subtracts 8 from esp <br />
(Storing the result in ESP). <br />
cmp(operation) is used to compare values, any operation beginning with j is used to jump to a different part of the code. <br />
For example: <br />
cmp DWORD PTR[ebp-4],0x9 <br />
jle 8048393 <main+0x1f> <br />
jmp 80483a6<main+0x32> <br />
Here the code first compares a 4 byte value located at EBP minus 4 ith the number 9, then execution jumps to the instruction at 0x8048393. Otherwise, execution flows to the next instruction with an unconditional jump. <br />
If the value isn't less than or equal to 9, execution will jump to 0x80483a6 <br />



# Memory Segmentation
A compiled program's memory =/5 (text, data, bss, heap, stack) Each segment has a certain purpose and it represents a special portion of the memory. <br />
The Text Segment (code Segment) <br />
This part of the memory stores the machine language instructions of the program. <br />
These instructions are executed in a non-linear way because of the high-level control structures and functions(which compile into branch,jump, and call instructions in assembly language). <br />
When a program is executed the $EIP register (or $RIP for me) is set to the frist instruction in the text segment. <br />
The processor then goes through an execution loop that does the followong : <br />
1. Reads the instruction that $EIP is pointing to <br />
2. Adds the byte length of the instruction to $EIP <br />
3. Executes the instruction that was read in step 1 <br />
4. Goes back to step 1 <br />

If the instruction is a jump or a call instruction($EIP is changed at step 3), The processor will just go back to step 1. <br />

Write Permission is disabled in this segment, as it is only used to store code. This is so that people dont modify the actual program code <br />
If anyone actually tries to write to this segment, the program will be killed. This memory segment has a fixed size since nothing changes in it. <br />

The Data and bss Segment <br />
Data segment stores initialized global and static variables. <br />
bss segment stores the uninitialized counterparts. <br />
These segments are writable but they also have a fixed size. <br />
Global variables persists, Both global and static variables are able to persist because they are stored in their own memory segments. <br />

The heap segment <br />
This segment can be directly controlled by a programmer. <br />
Blocks of memory in this segment can be allocated and used for
whatever the programmer might need.<br />
The heap memory doesn't have fixed size. <br />
allocator and deallocator algorithms are used to manage this memory <br />

The stack segment <br />
This segment also stores variables and context during function calls.<br />
When a program calls a function,
that function will have its own set of passed variables, and the functionâ€™s code
will be at a different memory location in the text (or code) segment.<br />
The stack is used to remember all of the passed variables, and all the local variables used by that function. <br />
All of this information is collectively called a *stack frame*.
A stack is an abstract data structure. IT has (FILO) ordering, which means that the first item that is put into a stack is the last item to come out of it. <br />
When an item is placed into a stack, it's known as pushing, and when an item is removed from a stack, it's called popping. <br />
The stack segment of a memory is a stack data structure and it containes *stack frames*. the $ESP register is used to keep track of the address at the end of the list. <br />
Since this is a dynamic behaviour, It makes sense that the stack is also not of a fixed size. <br />
The FILO nature of a stack might seem odd, but since the stack is used to store context, it's very useful. <br />
When you call a function(), you are acctually pushing several things to the stack in a stack frame <br />
The EBP register (the frame pointer or local base pointer) is used to reference the function variables in the current stack frame. <br />
Each stack frame contains the parameters to the function, its local variables, and two pointers that are necessary to put things back the way they were: the saved frame pointer (SFP) and the return address. <br />
The SFP is used to restore EBP to its previous value, and the return address is used to restore EIP to the next instructio nfound after the function call.<br />

# Some useful FLAGS for opening files
O_RDONLY :: Open file for read-only access. <br />
O_WRLONLY :: Open file for write-only access. <br />
O_RDW :: Open file for both read and write access.<br />
O_APPEND :: Write data at the end of the file.<br />
O_TRUNC :: If the file already exits, truncate the file to 0 length. <br />
O_CREAT :: Create the file if it doesn't exist<br />
